# Exercitiul 8
# Write a function that receives a number x, default value equal to 1, a list of strings, and a boolean flag set to True. 
# For each string, generate a list containing the characters that have the ASCII code divisible 
# by x if the flag is set to True, otherwise it should contain characters that have the ASCII code not divisible by x.
# Example: x = 2, ["test", "hello", "lab002"], flag = False 
# will return (["e", "s"], ["e" . Note: The function must return list of lists.
